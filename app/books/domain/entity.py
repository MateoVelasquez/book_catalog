"""Entities

Defines the basic properties of the entities in the application.
The representation of objects that will be managed in the system.


Note: You don't need to define the __init__ method when using @dataclass,
as this is done automatically.
You can omit it and let dataclass handle initialization for you.
This will simplify your code.
